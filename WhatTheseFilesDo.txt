Do you want to know what all these files do?
We will explain in case you think these files are virus.

1) "DO NOT DELETE OR RENAME ANY FILES" 
This file is just a warning, it doesn't do anything
if you click it. This file can be deleted if you want.

2) "download.exe"
This file is being used only when WiFi Password Viewer
checks for updates at the beginning before it loads.
download.exe does what it's name says. When WiFi Password Viewer
checks for updates then download.exe will download the file "version.bat"
which contains the latest version number.
Both files "download.exe" and "version.bat" SHOULDN'T be deleted OR renamed.

3) "V2.0 Changelog.txt"
This file contains all the changes the new update made.
It isn't important and you can delete it if you want.

4) "version.bat"
Explained above. But this file SHOULDN'T be deleted or renamed.

5) "WiFi-Password-Viewer-V2.0.bat"
